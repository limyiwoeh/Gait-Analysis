## ðŸ“œ Overview
The project focuses on:
- Processing gait motion data from `Project_Data.mat`.
- Estimating key gait parameters (e.g., step time, cadence, stride length).
- Performing specific analysis tasks described in the project report.
- Applying MATLAB digital signal processing techniques to extract meaningful gait metrics.
